    ## Note: This function used to test if there were additional columns of
    ## NAs with NA as column name that were created by a user manually inspecting
    ## a csv and accidentally clicking to the right of true columns and thus
    ## making new, unintended columns.  This used to be an error that readr did
    ## not parse differently from comma broken csv files.  readr now handles
    ## these types of csv file appropriately.

    cols  <- NULL

    ## The broken csv check works under the assumption that readr's `problem`
    ## function outputs a check with an expected and actual columns.  Broken
    ## csv files have a readr `problems` output that looks like this:

        ## > m <- readr::read_csv('Book1.csv')
        ## Warning: 2 parsing failures.
        ## row col  expected    actual
        ##   3  -- 6 columns 7 columns
        ##   5  -- 6 columns 1 columns

    ## Under the assumption that broken csv files will have a differening number
    ## expected and actual columns and that readr will report them in this
    ## fashion we can test for broken csv files by looking for `problems` output
    ## that have an expected column with the text "# columns" using the grep:
    ## "^\\d+\\s*columns$".
    ##
    ## This depends on readr always reporting broken csv files in this way.
    ##
    ## Known limitations:
    ##   1. This method will not catch broken csv files where there are
    ##      additional empty columns and the comma break pushes content into
    ##      these columns.

    ## First if/else is looking for (based on assumptions stated above):
    ##  1. readr `problems` function output problems w/ an 'expected' column
    ##  2. Does the 'expected' column contain the pattern "# columns"

    ## Check what elements of 'expected' column have "# columns" form
